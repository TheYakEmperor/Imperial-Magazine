I don’t think people choose their influences, and I don’t think conscious artistic expression is a credible source of musical transcendence. There are some who will laud <i>Illmatic</i> or <i>Ready to Die</i> as straight 10/10s due primarily to the presence of ‘hard-hitting’ sociopolitical commentary and so-called ‘urban grit’, while failing to account for the way both [records recoil from, even hate, the mantle of their predecessors]. They are both remarkably recumbent records; Biggie irreverent and braggadocious, Nas chilling on the straight and narrow. Biggie’s voice is a muggy summer afternoon, Nas’ an austere winter morning. The one true way to get to the crux of something is with metaphor. Babblers will babble on about ‘sonic intricacies’ and ‘artistic growth’ 

You can smell the grotty apartment, feel the stark, middle-afternoon snatches of clipped wind gusting through a flimsy pop filter, taste the sewage squid that Frank engorges himself on under the duress of rock paper scissors tournaments.

It is popularly assumed that the banjo descends from the [], a west African musical instrument, when really there is not a scrap of historical evidence to suggest that this is the case. Where people get confused is that Richard Jobson spoke of a Gambian string instrument which he named ‘bandore’, the same name that would later be applied to string instruments fashioned with gourds and guts in the West Indies by slaves, and which would eventually mutate into the word ‘banjo’. The etymology is Spanish, not African as many academics would like to tout. The African languages are so numerous and various that it is easy to fabricate, intentionally or not, an etymology from just about whatever word you like. It is contended whether the rhythms of the blues and of ragtime were from Africa or the continent, no one knows, never will because the whole debate is so marred with the competing political agendas of either side. 

Fulcrum of bucolic toil, the place of rural misery, the molested fields where I was born and shall again be sepulchred, in bloody dirt under the mournful eyes of pebbledash and uPVC.
