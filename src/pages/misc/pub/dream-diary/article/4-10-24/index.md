Nothing too interesting last night, just a string of unrelated vignettes that don't really add up to anything substantial. No particularly arresting imagery, either. It went as follows:

We (with whom I don’t remember) are on an extended trip and staying in some sort of hunting lodge that has been gutted and converted into a community library. 

I think there’s something about buses. I often dream about buses. I’m dropped off home, I nip into the supermarket and buy some Pringles. The Co-Op, probably, but not the thickset brown one located on the green at the end of the cul de sac that haunts me occasionally. 

My dad and I are in a car driving through some vague cityscape. He brings up Tom Felton (but he does not call him that), remarking on how good he was at playing an insectoid character through motion capture. He asks me something about the Oscars. I lampoon the glammed up glitterati and single out the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> cast for their sartorial humility. I see them, evidently in a flashback, heading down a road toward the ceremony, which I realise now is actually the entrance track from my old job. Like most dreams, it all seems familiar, but I can’t quite place it. 

An extended sequence takes place, and I’m at the bottom of a school grounds. It looks like the one from my old primary school, but there are too many floodlights and a building that didn’t used to be there. There’s something about cliques and filming a movie, then I’m in Wales, armed with a film camera, trying to capture a buzzard mid-flight. The vegetation seems denser and more magnificent than in reality. We have visitors. They gather in my room. I’m still in bed. We talk about music, I mention dance music, dad tells one of the visitors that I can take him outside and show him my musical talent. He somehow assumes that means I play an Indian musical instrument (I thought it was a sitar, but I’m not sure now). It sort of collapses after that and it’s all over.
