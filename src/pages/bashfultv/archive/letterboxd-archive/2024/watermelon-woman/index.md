<h3 style="padding-bottom:0;">The Watermelon Woman (1996)</h3>
<p style="color:grey;">Reviewed 9 May 2024</p>

“I know she meant the world to you, but she also meant the world to me, and those worlds are different.”

Going into this, I really didn’t think it’d be much, but I found myself beaming ear-to-ear throughout. In it, a young black lesbian, Cheryl, searches for the eponymous “Watermelon Woman”, a 1930s film actress whose legacy is long forgotten, pieced together only in the fragmented memories of those who knew her. I love movies that deal with the meta aspects of filmmaking and videography; much like Zelig, a mockumentary that tacitly details the Jewish-American experience, The Watermelon Woman is a mockumentary that details the African-American experience, specifically that of black women.

There is a lot of retro charm to this sparky and youthful production, as well as a good dollop of salt-of-the-earth authenticity, especially in the videotape segments which punctuate the main film narrative. The overriding documentary flair allows for an earnest, though not severe, portrayal of interpersonal drama which casually sidesteps being overly theatrical or outrageous in its depiction. Everything about it is very loose and naturalistic: the nervous energy of the two girls confessing their hots for each other is bang on, it's naturally funny without trying too hard and manages to be subversive without falling into the “angry young woman” trap; in fact, it is a very breezy, easy-going film. The Watermelon Woman celebrates the little things, the small moments that colour our lives, people who on the surface seem to have gone with the wind but who tainted the world in inconceivable ways.

Cheryl’s search ultimately comes to a dead end. Perhaps the Watermelon Woman really was the scandalous lover of a famous movie director, or maybe she was just another mammy actress who had her day. But that’s not really what the film’s about. It’s about how small, mysterious fragments of the past can manifest in the present and take us down some very strange roads in our search for their meaning. The final caption “The Watermelon Woman is fiction” leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Has Cheryl willed this woman into a more generous existence than was actually afforded to her? Was her biography fabricated? Was she even a real person to begin with? The files upon files of her in a so-called “Lesbian archive” seem like wish fulfilment more than anything. The film plays with different levels of reality in a very, very subtle manner which many viewers just won't pick up on. And that's because The Watermelon Woman is a very clever film.

⭐ 10/10
