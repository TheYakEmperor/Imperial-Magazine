Why is this movie. A patent rip-off of Pasolini's <i>Decameron</i> by two-bit hack director Piero Vivarelli (who is perhaps most notable for being the only Italian to receive membership for the Cuban Communist Party), there really isn't a compelling narrative here at all to make up for the shamelessly exploitative subject matter. There's something about an African king courting a queen and a troupe of dancing monkeys, but honestly, I'm already beginning to forget what happened. 

What's more interesting is that, for being so underwhelming, this film proved incredibly difficult to track down. The only source I could find was an unmarked DVD-R ripped with a poor VHS transfer and spotty subtitles which I had to buy custom for around Â£15 through a shady online dealer. I wasn't sure whether I had been ripped off until the thing arrived two months later, stuffed hastily inside a windowed envelope, only half-sealed by the dispassionate tongue of who I have to presume is a video contraband specialist wanted in all 196 countries that ratified the Geneva Conventions. It sits here in my collection now, like a purloined jewel gazing accusatorily at me whenever I turn on the TV. I'm not even sure where I got it, or why I got it, or who's going to come after me for having it. All I know is that sometimes the reward isn't worth the chase, nor is the guilt worth the (dis)pleasure.
