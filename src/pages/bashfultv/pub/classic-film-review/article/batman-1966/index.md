<i>They may be drinkers, Robin, but they’re also human beings</i>

Adam West may be the greatest actor to play Batman. No, I’m not joking. He lends genuine gravitas to otherwise farcical scripts. He is the star of his own show, even with 4 villains crowding him out, something which Bale and Affleck couldn’t manage. The scenes with Bruce and 'Kitka' are sumptuous and elegant, classy even, courtesy of West and Meriwether's masterful portrayals. But Burgess Meredith is the real scene-stealer here as main baddie Oswald Cobblepot. He is the liveliest of the quarrelling quartet, chomping toothsomely at the butt of his cigarette holder and squawking like a laryngitic parrot whenever the dynamic duo makes a blunder. It's a marvellous comedy performance. And that's really the crux of it. This movie is a riot. The protracted bomb disposal sequence is comic genius on the level of Monty Python, and I'm sure everyone is already well aware of the lionised shark assault and ensuing 'C for Catwoman' detective work. But there are so many little gags, too. This surely inhabits the upper crust of Batman movies, and is perhaps the most complete and wholesome of them all.
