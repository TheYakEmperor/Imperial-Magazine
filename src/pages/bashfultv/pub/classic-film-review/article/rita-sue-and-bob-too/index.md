A late great Grim Up North picture, dappled with pockets of 80s ambience exemplified by the Madness video playing on a squat television set at the start. The song is <i>House of Fun</i>, which tells the story of a coy 16-year-old boy who uses a string of euphemisms in order to clandestinely obtain a bumper pack of condoms from the chemist's. He's the sort of lad Rita and Sue were probably supposed to end up getting it off with, were it not for the influence of the titular Bob, a habitual bigamist for whom the girls' true affection is uncertain. Sue is the clear favourite, being a dead ringer for Bob's wife, Michelle, but Rita is the needier girl. 

What is interesting to note is that there aren’t any young male characters named aside from Sue's Pakistani boyfriend Aslam (one letter away from <i>Islam</i>, about which some unsavoury observations are made), whose mild manners belie a very real pestering abusiveness, something which prophesies the future of medium-sized urban centres such as Bradford all over the UK. 

Lesley Sharp as Michelle is the standout. Her piercing blue eyes are like two daggers to the heart, her voice a scorning drawl which hardly seems to stop for breath (see her also in <i>Naked</i>, <i>The Full Monty</i>, and Doctor Who's <i>Midnight</i>). But the main character of this film is the 1980s itself; its ambience soaks the grass a verdant blue-green, dyes the clothes a pastel rainbow, and frankly butchers the hair. One thing I've noticed is that you can watch a million films set in the 1980s and still never really <i>get</i> the 1980s, just as you can watch a million adaptations of <i>Hamlet</i> and still never really get <i>Hamlet</i>. The reality of such periods is necessarily tampered with by the artifice of dramaturgy and mise-en-scène, just as the human condition is manipulated by enforced catharsis. Once over, periods in time crystallise to become multivalent prisms, accessible only via the subjective memory of a few people who've forgotten more than they remember. One could go the route of seeking the accountant's truth, as Werner Herzog would put it, or one could instead be satisfied by poetic allusions to stray dogs and underage flings in a time just preceding the cusp of familiarity, realising it as infinitely more important.
