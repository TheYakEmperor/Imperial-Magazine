A base, libidinal film disguised as historical fantasy-adventure. The fragmentary nature of Petronius' book is reflected here in the piecemeal narrative portrayed through a series of loose vignettes that capture places of rural misery and their sybaritic predators, where sexual perversion is venerated and purity is neologism. The city of Rome is a panopticon of debauchery, the countryside a desert of marauders and highwaymen. In every frame there is a darkly lascivious undercurrent. Nudity is stark and obvious, not titillating. The boys are beautiful but unattractive. By slapping his name in the title, Fellini tells us that in this story of ancient Rome is reflected the sobering simile of contemporary Italy. Degeneracy is generational, ultimately. William Blake's 'every harlot was a virgin once' comes to mind, along with the bilateral visage of Roman she-tramp Cabiria and besotted waif Gelsomina, in whose hysterical tears is panegyrised the blood of a million slain Encolpios.
