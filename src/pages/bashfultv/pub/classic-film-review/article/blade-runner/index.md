The fantastical retro-presage of 2019's Los Angeles hangs about in a neo-primordial ooze composed of oriental superstrata and a hardscrabble down-and-dirty jobbing lot. These are the streets where oil-paper parasols and gothic gamps are carried alike, where multiculturalism is allowed to exist by virtue of every resident's blinkered solipsism and the ignorance of an invisible elite. There is no enthusiasm but in the haggling for bits and bobs, the menageries of chirruping techno-exotica, the pseudo-sexual blear of adult performers and predatory advertising campaigns projected onto monolithic jumbotrons. The earth and the sky are braced apart by plates and rivets, and the rain goes on forever in search of consummation between the two, which it will never find. From its broiling ambience are born cerulean monotony and lashing constancy, which are the miasmas, the stinks, the airborne plagues that infest the city, engendering an antisocially agreeable populace that devotes itself to commercial recreation and never has enough time on its hands. Roy accepts death in the rain, just as all humans of the city must do.
