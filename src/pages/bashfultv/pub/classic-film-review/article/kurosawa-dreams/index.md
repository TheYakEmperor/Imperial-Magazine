Don't films like this just make you want to explore the world? I think all of us have a village of water wheels inside us. Kurosawa finds in it a facsimile of his home—following the great war, nuclear devastation, and predation by corporate, self-loathing demons—which his erstwhile self could not find in the sanctified but static Van Gogh. There is a peculiarly haunting notion that having witnessed the foxes' wedding may have kick-started the chain reaction that leads to the collapse of Japanese principles on a societal level; the defiance of strange traditions such as are found in old wives' tales is observably the first domino to fall on the long road to cultural vandalism.

In a country devoid of tradition, earthly customs and long life exist in small pockets, unnamed settlements that sustain themselves and nothing more. These are the places we go to die, but life is good, maintains the wise old man who can't be far from death himself. It is conceited to long for serenity only when we are dying. Kurosawa, the tourist, in his Oxford button-down, wanders off, sated with the commodity, bookmarking the location of his deathbed. He adores the flowers and the river and the lurid veils, just as we enjoy the pearly gates and silken cloths of Heaven. Who now knows the depth of these symbols? Modern man is a sightseer of his own heritage.

The final homage to Tarkovsky accompanied by modal oboe music is like nothing else on film.
