Brando is a true diamond in the rough. He shines brightest in simple stories where the emphasis is placed on character and performance as opposed to set-pieces. On the Waterfront might be his finest outing. Like all the greatest films, nothing really happens in it. It's all talking. But it is never boring. These old classics have a wonderful way of restraining themselves. There are overtures to a gunfight which never happens, intimations of mobsters and gang warfare and judicial inquests, but the focus is always on Brando and his fellow working men. I'm not sure whether I appreciate the ending or not. It's too happy, too obvious. I wouldn't be surprised if a first draft of this script saw Brando's character killed by Friendly, but was deemed too bleak.
