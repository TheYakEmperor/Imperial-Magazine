I like to frame the two Joker movies as a sort of Crime and Punishment. The first movie is Crime, the second is Punishment. <i>Joker</i> was about guilty pleasures, <i>Joker 2</i> is about guilty consciences. They're wildly different films. I suppose, then, that this sequel was never intended to make for pleasant viewing, but I don't think people should be browbeaten into rescinding their love for the first one, either. The scene in which Arthur shoots Murray has incredible momentum, for example, and made for quite the cinematic frisson of the year. I also don't want to get into the territory of making out that <i>Folie à Deux</i> was supposed to be unenjoyable and that that alone means it's worthy of the discerning cineaste's plaudits—that's a little too post-modern for my liking—but it certainly zigs where the first movie zagged, and I always have time for ambition, whether it's a hit with general audiences or not. This falls firmly into the latter category, it would seem, and is sure to top all the 'most polarising of 2024' polls, despite not really being polarising at all (no, mass public repudiation is not the same as polarisation; they're actually total opposites).
