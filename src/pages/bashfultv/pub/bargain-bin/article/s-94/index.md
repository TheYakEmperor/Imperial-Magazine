What a fall from grace. There are only so many words I can conjure up to describe this listless, insipid farce. It has all the bells and whistles of your average post-apocalyptic potboiler, what with the fetish gas masks and hazmat suits, but misses the mark in just about every area: plot, character, direction, locations, music (which sounds like something a teenaged COD player would listen to in 2006), and yes, even costuming. It plays out like a particularly turgid student film, which is shocking coming from a director with an otherwise exemplary track record when it comes to outsider flicks. It's a shame to see such a revolutionary filmmaker descend so rapidly into sleaze and poor taste. The direct-to-video market and its consequences have been a disaster for humanity, as well as cinematic humanism, probably.
