This is a film often talked about but rarely seen. Infamously sobriquet'd as 'the film that killed the UK Film Council', it portrays the last vestiges of a world gone by, a world of flat-roofed pubs and single-product food delivery and blowing half your fag money at the bookies on a bank holiday Monday. Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook are suitably grotty-looking actors for the environments they inhabit, which include a disreputable watering hole, a fluorescent, grimed-up chip shop, and some semi-detached council houses. The narrative consists entirely of the two fumbling about trying to get laid with similarly grotty women. 

On paper, it sounds like decent craic. But it's not. Question is, why? In the twenty years since its release, or rather escape, many have dramatically postulated as to why it's such a terrible movie. It's in bad taste, they say, it's insalubrious, it's irresponsible, it's dirty, etc. ad infinitum. But it's much simpler than that. The reason it doesn't work is because it's a sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny. Perhaps, then, it can appositely be called the bookend of the Great British Sex Comedy, in the same vein that <i>One Missed Call</i> was the bookend of J-horror and the <i>Divergent</i> movies were the bookend of the Young Adult dystopian novel adaptation and <i>Disaster Movie</i> and <i>Meet the Spartans</i> were the joint bookend of the outrageous parody flick. <i>Sex Lives of the Potato Men</i> earns the peculiar honour of being a funeral cort√®ge for a filmic tradition. Watch it if you wish to mourn.
