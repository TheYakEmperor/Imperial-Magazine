It's fine, really. Hardly the televisual abomination that outrage merchants make it out to be, but still nowhere near the threshold that stands in the way of 'good'. I get why certain demographics would enjoy <i>Agatha</i>; it's simultaneously gentle and quaintly bitchy enough that middle-aged housewives who grew up with <i>The Witches of Eastwick</i> and <i>Hocus Pocus</i> can get their rocks off to it, and anodyne enough that the jobbing Marvel fan can sit through it fairly comfortably and absorb it as a small piece of the mythos. Seriously, it's not <i>awful</i>.
