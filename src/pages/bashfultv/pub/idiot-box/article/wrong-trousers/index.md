A cozy pastiche that feels both older and newer than it actually is. Wallace himself is an ode to our illustrious lineage of absent-minded professors (Branestawm, Calculus, Caractacus Potts, etc.), where Gromit is the see-much-evil-speak-no-evil Cassandran figure who has no mouth and must scream. It's the perfect duo. Feathers McGraw is the archetypal unassuming bad guy; his black-bead eyes are cute for a time, but made disquieting by lingering shots of him leering around the house and staring soullessly into the camera.

Watched in preparation for the upcoming <i>Vengeance Most Fowl</i>, which I will cover as a part of a Christmas omnibus review.
