The Obamas finance a limited series in which Irish people are portrayed as idling, drunken, pixilated buffoons who still believe in fairies and who go out of their way to obscure information for no real reason other than to keep our plucky protagonists on their toes. Speaking of, our trisomic trio consists of a hardarse Dubliner journalist with a chequered past and a habit of going against the grain to get scoops, an imbecilic American true crime podcaster, and his airhead of a co-host, who proves too ethnically diverse and womanish to feature purely as comic relief and so is allowed at least a few pats on the back from her more Eurocentric castmates before the show wraps up. Lots of playful-but-not-really 'hurr durr Americans are stoopad and fat' humour features within, which is hardly surprising coming from an Irish/we-hate-our-country-American (read: Californian nouveau riche) production that has one foot firmly rooted in 1965 and another havering nervously over the near future that Middle England chatterers and country house bumpkins dream about in between sessions of checking the Guardian to see if owning your own car has been abolished yet.
