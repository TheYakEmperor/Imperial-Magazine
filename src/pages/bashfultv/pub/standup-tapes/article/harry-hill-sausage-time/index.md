Really doesn't hit the heights of his late 90s/early 2000s stuff. Far too silly in a stupid way without the cleverness of his early work. The original "Live" was a great start, with "Man Alive" as the pinnacle before it started to get a bit too slapstick and over-reliant on props and novelty gags. Hill's early "comedy for all the family" approach quickly devolved into plain childishness, while the cultural references "for the adults" became less and less relevant as the years chugged on, to the point where a lot of the jokes in his old sets are voided by the lack of a zeitgeist to contextualise them. Still, it's not a total loss. Hill's work never feels spiteful or exploitative. It is never marred with political hangups, sexual frustrations or pet hates; it's just plain fun, even if that means it's unsophisticated. Then again, there's little to distract from the fact that this very much feels like a last gasp. As of 2024, this is Harry Hill's final video release.
