The best <i>NAN!?!?</i> on film. 

An ode to ambivalence and furious purposelessness. Those who would secrete away masculine libido as a pornographic measure for their own sexual gratification abhor it as monstrous when it's roaming the streets. To live as a factory-reset man in the modern world is to be captured and recaptured endlessly, both by corporations wanting to maintain societal austerity and psychopathic women looking to flick their beans while enacting a power-fantasy. Pinocchio's ball and chain, both proverbially and literally, wants to fuck and kill him all at once. I don't know whether it's a polemic on contemporary feminism or some sado-masochist's idea of a good time, but either way, you'd have to be crazy to pass this one up. On one level, it is deeply, deeply meaningless, and on another level entirely, it speaks to all people who wander the city and are maddened by apathy and weird stares. 

Emetophobes and epileptics, consider yourself forewarned.
