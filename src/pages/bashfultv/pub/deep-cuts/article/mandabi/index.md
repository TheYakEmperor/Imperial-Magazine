Discussion over African film tends to be marred with the condescending tincture of what I like to call 'congratulatism', a sort of 'well done for trying' attitude that infantilises artists of underrepresented groups. One could mention, for example, that <i>Mandabi</i> was the first feature-length African-language film, or that it was Africa's first film shot in colour, among such other accomplishments, but I want to veer away from that pernicious brand of quantification. It cannot do us any good on a humanist level and denigrates the individual merit of art on the basis of having done this and that before anyone else. The vague and ultimately deleterious notion of 'trailblazing' is one that keeps at bay the actual value of art. No, instead I wish to discuss this film because it is a fantastically ironic development on European neo-realist cinema, worth far more than the pity of cultural flaneurs and post-colonial opportunists. 

It meanders in the same way that a Fellini or a De Sica does. There is hardly a beginning, a middle, or an end. Ibrahima is beset by financial misfortune brought about by his own reckless altruism and the careless spending of his wives. A proud, pious man, he is pilfered from by beggars, religious swindlers, conmen, and, in the end, his own well-to-do nephew, in what appears to be an unending string of deceit and betrayal. The film's conclusion is full of pathos but entirely devoid of dramatics. It is <i>funny</i>, almost. Ibrahima repudiates his religious constancy and vows to become a cheater and a liar to get by. This is the fragility of God, says Sembène, who is a fine, fine director indeed, and who captures these goings-on with a semi-guerrilla style that feels neither too voyeuristic nor too distant. There is hardly any visual flair, either; the cinematography is plain and understated, capturing the actors and their environments and not much else. 

I just wish films like this were easier to track down. It is a crime that so many like it have doubtless sat untouched on dusty shelves for half a century. What a miracle that this gem ended up resurfacing and was restored so magnificently.
