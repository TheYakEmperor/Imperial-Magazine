An oneiric maze of delusion and elucidation, a hall of mirrors against which is projected a scathing portrait of the particular misery of countryside living, the promulgation of cruel grapevines, the homespun tyranny of devouring mothers, and the curious way in which objects of childhood fascination become fetishistic fixations upon sexual maturity. 

As is the case with most Terayamas, <i>Grass Labyrinth</i> is at least loosely autobiographical in its remit, and covers a young man's transition from childhood to adulthood. Akira is raped by an imprisoned temptress, just as a young Terayama is raped in <i>Pastoral: To Die in the Country</i> by the woman made to drown her own baby. Now, that is a perplexing pattern: rape by the persecuted woman as initiation into sexual maturity. The underlying reason is no doubt folded deeply into the fabric of these cinematographic dreams, which pulse along like lowly earthworms and stop short of any real catharsis. Circumstance and reflection are the two cornerstones of Terayama's filmography. Both, however, are liable to warp when for so long they are secreted away in the depths of recollection and in the catacombs of thought.
