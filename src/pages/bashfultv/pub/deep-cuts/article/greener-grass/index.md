This movie feels like a satire of a satire. We follow an overzealous soccer mom who is haunted by a murderous transvestite (an analogue for the Middle American ‘other’) and a husband who harvests pool water for drinking. Halfway through, their son is transformed into a dog. This is brilliant. Unfortunately, it's the only brilliant thing in the film. While a golden retriever being led to school in a shirt and tie by his put-upon mother is certainly an interesting visual, it doesn't really go anywhere thematically. The filmmakers instead go the lazy route of having most of the film be a slideshow of typical suburban purlieus and situations; garden parties, schools built like prisons, low-ability kids pushed into activities for over-achievers, school talent shows, crustless sandwiches, the notion of children being quasi-Satanically influenced by hyperbolically uncouth TV programmes; only exaggerated to the superlative degree. That's the habit of most average parodies: make the subtle unsubtle. Pure observation and embellishment. No subversion. 

<i>Greener Grass</i> screams a single one-dimensional message through its saliva-sodden braces: suburban life is disgusting and fake. Well, what if I propose that the way this movie pretends to be offbeat and artsy is disgusting and fake? Its strangeness is agonisingly self-conscious and affected. It begs people to see it as deep and artful, but all it's doing is delivering weird sight gag after weird sight gag in a vain attempt to shock the viewer into appreciating it as absurdist genius. This bare-faced racket is undermined, however, by the fact that despite the film's fairly striking in-camera visuals, it still has that desultory television look that direct-to-streaming movies just can’t seem to escape. 

The one slight bit of compelling subtext I could find was that during the classroom scene, Miss Human is discussing the history of the prairies and omits mentioning the Native Americans. Presumably this particular suburb was built over ancient Indian stomping grounds, later made apparent by the revelation that the children have been playing soccer on a burial site all along. A neat bit of cultural bandwagonism, if nothing else, even if it does come across as distinctly PSA-ey and more than a little racist.
