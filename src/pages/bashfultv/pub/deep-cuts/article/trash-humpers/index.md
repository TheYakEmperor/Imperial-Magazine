The sort of movie you wish you could unrecognise. 

I don’t know if the term ‘ambient film’ has been used before, but it sums up <i>Trash Humpers</i> to a tee. It's like a strange, slightly eerie background hum, a visual tone poem lacking in catharsis, cohesion, character and consequence. This is perhaps trash cinema at its most authentic. One could easily buy this as a collection of sordid home videos assembled by some bored teenagers, were it not for the seriously sinister, unplayful tone and moments of intimate bizarro and stark creepiness. What you'll notice is that the background cackling isn’t collegiate or incidental, it’s all in-character.

Post-bawd shock flicks such as this share a lineage with the likes of <i>Pink Flamingos</i> and <i>Freddy Got Fingered</i>, recalcitrant horrors that capture a time more faithfully than the serious films do. <i>Trash Humpers</i> in particular might be billed as <i>Bum Fights<i/> meets <i>Jackass</i> meets <i>Filthy Frank</i> ('Soap Pancakes' is more than a little reminiscent of 'Hair Cake'). There is something distinctly YouTube-y about it, after all. The sequence involving the spooks smashing TVs in a parking lot reminds me of those tech destruction channels that were popular around 2016. This is owed in part to the DIY cinematography but also to the reckless, feckless freedom of it all (one must remember the 'wild west' days of the web; Christ I'm sounding old).

It alternatively doubles as found footage from the universe that gave us <i>Possibly in Michigan</i> and <i>Shaye Saint John</i>. Or perhaps it can be instead summed up as simply a revolt against what is called ‘good taste’. The film ends with images of nighttime suburbia and a somewhat poignant monologue from one of the spooks, a reproach of normality and the overbearing comfort of middle-class living. 'Make it, don’t fake it' is <i>Trash Humpers</i>' watchword. These guys made it alright, just as Jimmy Savile and Harvey Weinstein did.
