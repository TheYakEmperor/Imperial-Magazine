The Kali Yuga is here, and <i>Denchu-Kozo</i> is our enlightening Kalki. <i>Tetsuo</i>'s offbeat twin sister synthesises elements of cyberpunk and gothic fantasy to tell the story of a technologically disfigured teenager, tormented by his sadistic classmates, who is enlisted in a war against a coterie of vampires in the process of incubating a super-weapon which will cloak the world in a pall of eternal darkness. It is certainly sprightlier and more facetious than Tsukamoto's later work, and carries with it a weightless energy that soars during the madcap action scenes. The way it is shot indicates that an epileptic squirrel might have been operating the camera. It chatters through its runtime like a spastic electrical pulse, rapid and disorderly, its calmest moments undercut by the fact that its main character has a fucking telegraph pole sprouting from his back. What insane genius. It's like Kafka without subtext, Lynch without braggadocio, and Tsukamoto without someone telling him to buck up his ideas.
