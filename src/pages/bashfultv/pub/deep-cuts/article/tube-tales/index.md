Does exactly what it says on the tin: it’s some stories set on the tube. I first discovered this as the sole film in Ewan McGregor’s directorial filmography aside from the disastrous <i>American Pastoral</i>, which piqued my curiosity. Then I noticed Armando Iannucci's name in the credits, and I just had to give it a go. This is one of those scrappy British social realism anthologies that puts nasty, gimmicky filler material ahead of genuine interpersonal drama and comedic catharsis. 

There's the overriding theme that people and the world are awful, because of course, but there's no real exploration here. It seems just to have been designed to depress and disgust. Why is it that young British directors believe filming urban gloom is enough to feign prestige? The humour is also abysmal. A dirty old man gets an erection in a busy carriage after being seduced by a scaggy bimbo. It’s funny cause he’s got a boner in a public place where there’s lots of people and that’s embarrassing. D’you get it? That is an example of the simple and dull extent to which these vignettes take the idea of being confined in an underground metal tube with lots of people. To its credit though, Bob Hoskins’ <i>My Father the Liar</i> is a standout piece. There's something genuinely insidious about it. 

To think if they had just taken this a little more seriously, something really interesting might have come of it. As it stands, 7 of the 9 segments are passable at best, and one is awful. Interesting to see Simon Pegg in his first film credit, though.
